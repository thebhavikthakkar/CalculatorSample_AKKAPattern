# CalculatorSample_AKKAPattern

This is a console-based calculator application that demonstrates the use of the Actor Model architecture with Akka.NET. The application focuses on adhering to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, SOLID principles, and utilizing .NET Core for cross-platform development.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into separate projects/modules within the solution to achieve modularity and separation of concerns:

- **CalculatorCore:** Contains the core business logic and domain-specific entities.
- **CalculatorInfra:** Handles the infrastructure, including user interface interactions.
- **CalculatorApp:** Contains the main application code and entry point.

## Features

- Perform basic calculator operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Use the Actor Model architecture with Akka.NET to handle asynchronous communication.
- Implement user-friendly console-based user interface.
- Adhere to SOLID principles for clean and maintainable code.
- Encapsulate operations using a Factory Method pattern.
- Follow best practices for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file (`CalculatorApp.sln`) in your preferred IDE.

## How to Use

1. Run the application by starting the `CalculatorApp` project.
2. Follow the prompts to enter numbers and select an operation.
3. View the calculated result and choose to perform another calculation or exit.
